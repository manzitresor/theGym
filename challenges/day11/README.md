## All Star Code Challenge
Create a function that accepts a string and a single character, and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

```sh
("Hello", 'o')  =>  1
("Hello", 'l')  =>  2
("", 'z')       =>  0
```

## Sum without highest and lowest number

Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

Mind the input validation.

## EXAMPLE

```sh

{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6

```
