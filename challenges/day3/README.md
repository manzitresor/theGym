## Powers of 2 

Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

### Examples

```sh 
n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]
```
