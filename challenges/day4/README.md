## Multiply the number

Jack really likes his number five: the trick here is that you have to multiply each number by 5 raised to the number of digits of each numbers, so, for example:

```sh
  3 -->    15  (  3 * 5¹)
 10 -->   250  ( 10 * 5²)
200 --> 25000  (200 * 5³)
  0 -->     0  (  0 * 5¹)
 -3 -->   -15  ( -3 * 5¹)
```

## String Reordering

The input will be an array of dictionaries.

Return the values as a string-seperated sentence in the order of their keys' integer equivalent (increasing order).

The keys are not reoccurring and their range is -999 < key < 999. The dictionaries' keys & values will always be strings and will always not be empty.

```sh 
Input:
List = [
        {'4': 'dog' }, {'2': 'took'}, {'3': 'his'},
        {'-2': 'Vatsan'}, {'5': 'for'}, {'6': 'a'}, {'12': 'spin'}
       ]

Output:
'Vatsan took his dog for a spin'
```
